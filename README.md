# Synchronization-of-threads-Project2

This is a similar project to project1 of thread synchronization. This project doesn't take any input. There are three types of 
threads used in this project named as Clock, Visitors and Speaker each with some jobs and routines. The output file can further
describe what each and every thread is doing in code.
Note: Each line of output file is an action performed by a thread and numbers in square bracket [] show the time (in milisecond) action
performed at.
